Part 5
1.	Repository: It is basically like an history where you can see all your work done before. It also stays in .git working copy or subdirectory.
2.	Commit: This process is very simple and straightforward it only helps or allows to add changes in the history of the repository and then can assign a commit name to it.
3.	Push: The Push process is similar to Pull process it takes all the commit data and merges it.
4.	Branch: In the repository system there can be more than one or more branches which can be merged when needed. It is the control system of the independent process.
5.	Fork: Fork is nothing but a copy of repository, by forking the repository it allows us to make changes freely without affecting the original program.
6.	Merge: merging is basically used to merge two or more commits it is not an direct branch to the commit it also known an ancestor branch.
7.	Clone: A clone is an copy of object or data of the same object.
8.	Pull: This process is nothing but it changes from the remote repository into the current git repository.
9.	Pull request: Pull request you to tell others about the changes you have pushed to one repository. Once a request is sent the parties interested in it will see the changes made in the repository.
